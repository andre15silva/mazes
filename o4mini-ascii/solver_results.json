You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

(traversable)\n\nCoordinates are 0-indexed: (0,0) is the top-left, (24,24) is the bottom-right.\nStart position: (1, 0)\nEnd position:   (23, 24)\n\nRules:\n  1. You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5. You cannot revisit any cell (including the start and end points if part of a longer path attempt).\n  6. You must return a valid path from the start to the end.\n  7. You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8. You must NOT return an empty path, there is a solution to the maze.\n\nOutput:\n  - A single Python list of (row, col) tuples, in order from the start to the end, including both endpoints.\n  - The entire list must appear on one line, with no extra text or commentary.\n\nHere is the maze map (each line is one row):\n#########################\n..#.......#.#.......#.#.#\n#.#####.###.#.#####.#.#.#\n#.#.#.............#.#...#\n#.#.#####.###########.#.#\n#.#.............#.#...#.#\n#.#######.#######.###.###\n#...#.#.#.........#...#.#\n#.#.#.#.###.#########.#.#\n#.#...#.......#...#.#...#\n#####.#####.###.###.#.###\n#.......#.....#.....#...#\n#.#####.###.###.#####.###\n#.#...#...#.#...#.......#\n#####.###.#.#.#####.#####\n#.#.....................#\n#.###.###.#######.###.#.#\n#.....#.....#.#.....#.#.#\n#.###.###.###.#######.###\n#.#...#.#.#.......#.....#\n#######.#.#.#########.###\n#.....#.......#.#.#.....#\n#.###.###.###.#.#.#####.#\n#.#.........#.........#..\n#########################",

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5. You cannot revisit any cell (including the start and end points if part of a longer path attempt).\n  6. You must return a valid path from the start to the end.\n  7. You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8. You must NOT return an empty path, there is a solution to the maze.\n\nOutput:\n  - A single Python list of (row, col) tuples, in order from the start to the end, including both endpoints.\n  - The entire list must appear on one line, with no extra text or commentary.\n\nHere is the maze map (each line is one row):\n###########################\n....#...#.#...#.......#.#.#\n###.#.#.#.#.#####.#####.#.#\n#.#.#.#.#.......#...#.....#\n#.#.#.###.#######.###.#####\n#.#.#.#.......#.#.........#\n#.#.#.###.#####.#.###.#####\n#...#.#.#.....#.....#.#...#\n###.#.#.#.#####.###.#####.#\n#.....#.#.#.#...#.....#...#\n###.#.#.#.#.#.###.#######.#\n#...#.#.#.#...#...#.#...#.#\n#.#####.#.#.#######.###.#.#\n#.#...#...#.....#...#.....#\n#.###.#.###.###.###.###.###\n#.#.#.......#.....#.#.....#\n#.#.#.#####.#######.#.#####\n#...#...#.#...#.#.#.#.#.#.#\n#.#.#.###.#####.#.#.#.#.#.#\n#.#.................#.#...#\n#####.###.#.#.###.###.#.#.#\n#.....#...#.#...#.......#.#\n#####.###.#.#.###.###.#.###\n#.....#...#.#.#.....#.#...#\n#.###.###.###########.###.#\n#...#...#...........#...#..\n###########################",

You must NOT return an empty path, there is a solution to the maze.\n\nOutput:\n  - A single Python list of (row, col) tuples, in order from the start to the end, including both endpoints.\n  - The entire list must appear on one line, with no extra text or commentary.\n\nHere is the maze map (each line is one row):\n###############################\n......#.#.#...........#.....#.#\n#.#.###.#.###.###.#####.#####.#\n#.#.#...........#.#.#...#.....#\n###.#####.#.#.#.###.#.#######.#\n#.....#.#.#.#.#...#...#.......#\n#.###.#.#######.###.#####.#####\n#.#.#.#...#.#.#.#...#.#.......#\n#.#.###.###.#.#.###.#.#.#######\n#.#.#.#.#.#...#.#.......#.#...#\n#.#.#.#.#.###.#.###.###.#.###.#\n#.........#.#.#.......#...#...#\n#######.###.#.#.###.#######.#.#\n#...#...#.#.....#.#...#...#.#.#\n###.###.#.###.###.#.#.#.#####.#\n#.#.#.#...#.#.#.....#...#...#.#\n#.#.#.#.###.#######.#.###.###.#\n#.........#.....#...#.#.......#\n#.#.###.###.#######.###.#######\n#.#...#.........#.#...........#\n#######.###.#####.#.###.#######\n#.#...#.#.#.#...#.#.#.........#\n#.###.#.#.###.###.#.###.###.###\n#.......#...#.........#.#.#...#\n#####.#.###.###.#######.#.#####\n#.....#.#.#.#.#...#.#.........#\n#####.###.#.#.#.###.#####.#####\n#...#.#.#...#.....#.#.#.#.....#\n###.#.#.###.#.#####.#.#.#######\n#..............................\n###############################",

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

(traversable)\n\nCoordinates are 0-indexed: (0,0) is the top-left, (28,28) is the bottom-right.\nStart position: (1, 0)\nEnd position:   (27, 28)\n\nRules:\n  1. You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5. You cannot revisit any cell (including the start and end points if part of a longer path attempt).\n  6. You must return a valid path from the start to the end.\n  7. You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8. You must NOT return an empty path, there is a solution to the maze.\n\nOutput:\n  - A single Python list of (row, col) tuples, in order from the start to the end, including both endpoints.\n  - The entire list must appear on one line, with no extra text or commentary.\n\nHere is the maze map (each line is one row):\n#############################\n..#.....#.#...#...#.#.#.#.#.#\n#.###.###.#.###.###.#.#.#.#.#\n#.#.#.....#.#.....#.#.......#\n#.#.#####.#.###.###.#.#######\n#.....#.#.....#...#.........#\n###.###.#.#.#.#.###.#.#######\n#...#.#.#.#.#.....#.#...#...#\n###.#.#.#####.#######.#####.#\n#.#.#...#.......#.#.....#...#\n#.#.###.#####.#.#.###.#.###.#\n#.....#.#.#.#.#.#.#...#...#.#\n#####.#.#.#.###.#.###.#####.#\n#.......#.......#.....#.....#\n#######.#####.#######.#.#####\n#.#.#.......#.#.....#.#.#...#\n#.#.#######.#.#####.#.#.#.###\n#.....#.#.......#.#.........#\n#.#####.#####.###.#.###.#####\n#.....#.#...#.#.#.....#.#...#\n###.###.###.#.#.#.#######.###\n#.......#.#.............#...#\n#.#.###.#.#.#########.#.###.#\n#.#.#...............#.#.#...#\n#####.#.###.###.#########.###\n#.....#.#...#.#...#.........#\n#.###.#######.#.#######.#.#.#\n#.#.....#...............#.#..\n#############################",

(traversable)\n\nCoordinates are 0-indexed: (0,0) is the top-left, (30,30) is the bottom-right.\nStart position: (1, 0)\nEnd position:   (29, 30)\n\nRules:\n  1. You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5. You cannot revisit any cell (including the start and end points if part of a longer path attempt).\n  6. You must return a valid path from the start to the end.\n  7. You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8. You must NOT return an empty path, there is a solution to the maze.\n\nOutput:\n  - A single Python list of (row, col) tuples, in order from the start to the end, including both endpoints.\n  - The entire list must appear on one line, with no extra text or commentary.\n\nHere is the maze map (each line is one row):\n###############################\n....#.#...#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.....#\n#.###.###.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.###.#\n#...#.#.......#.#.#.........#.#\n#.###.###.#.###.#.#.###.#.#####\n#.....#.#.#.#.......#...#.#.#.#\n#.#####.#.###.#####.#######.#.#\n#.#.#.#...#.......#.....#...#.#\n#.#.#.###.#.#.#############.#.#\n#...#.#.#...#...#.#.#.....#...#\n###.#.#.#.#######.#.#####.#.###\n#.#.....#.......#.#.#.........#\n#.#.#.#.#.###.###.#.#####.#.#.#\n#...#.#...#.....#...#.....#.#.#\n###.#####.###.#.###.###.#####.#\n#.#.#.#...#.#.#.#.#.#...#.#...#\n#.###.###.#.#.###.#.###.#.#.#.#\n#.....#.....#.#.....#...#.#.#.#\n#####.###.#######.###.###.#####\n#.#.#...#...#.#.#.#.........#.#\n#.#.#.###.###.#.#.#.###.#####.#\n#.....#...#.........#.....#...#\n#####.###.###.###.#.###.###.#.#\n#...............#.#.#.#.#...#.#\n###.#####.#.#.#.#.#.#.###.#####\n#.....#...#.#.#.#.#.........#.#\n###.#####.#########.###.#.###.#\n#...#...#...#.#...#.#.#.#.#...#\n#.#.#.#.#.###.#.#.#.#.#.#####.#\n#.#.#.#.........#.#...#........\n###############################",

(traversable)\n\nCoordinates are 0-indexed: (0,0) is the top-left, (30,30) is the bottom-right.\nStart position: (1, 0)\nEnd position:   (29, 30)\n\nRules:\n  1. You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5. You cannot revisit any cell (including the start and end points if part of a longer path attempt).\n  6. You must return a valid path from the start to the end.\n  7. You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8. You must NOT return an empty path, there is a solution to the maze.\n\nOutput:\n  - A single Python list of (row, col) tuples, in order from the start to the end, including both endpoints.\n  - The entire list must appear on one line, with no extra text or commentary.\n\nHere is the maze map (each line is one row):\n###############################\n....#.#...#.......#.#.#.#.#...#\n#.#.#.###.#######.#.#.#.#.###.#\n#.#.#.......#.#.#.#...#.#.#...#\n#.#####.#####.#.#.###.#.#.#.###\n#.#.#...#.#.#.#.......#.......#\n#.#.###.#.#.#.###.#.#.#.#######\n#...#.#.#...#.#.#.#.#.#...#...#\n#.###.#.#.###.#.###.###.#####.#\n#.....#...#...#...#...#...#.#.#\n#####.#.###.###.#.#.###.###.#.#\n#...#...#.#...#.#.#...#.#.#...#\n#.###.#.#.#.#.#.###.###.#.#.###\n#.....#...#.#.#.....#.#.#.....#\n#.#####.#.###.#####.#.#.#.#.#.#\n#.#.#.#.#.#.....#...#.#...#.#.#\n#.#.#.#.#.#.#######.#.#.#######\n#.#...#.#.#.................#.#\n#####.###.#.###.#.#.###.###.#.#\n#.#.#.#.......#.#.#...#.#.....#\n#.#.#.###.#.#####.###.#.#####.#\n#.........#.....#.#.#.#.#.#...#\n#####.#####.#.###.#.###.#.###.#\n#.....#.#...#...#.#.........#.#\n###.#.#.###.#.#####.#.#.###.#.#\n#...#.#.....#.#.....#.#.#...#.#\n###.#.###.#.###.###.###.###.#.#\n#...#...#.#...#.#...#...#...#.#\n#.#.###.#######.###.###.#.#.###\n#.#.#.....#.....#.....#.#.#....\n###############################",

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5. You cannot revisit any cell (including the start and end points if part of a longer path attempt).\n  6. You must return a valid path from the start to the end.\n  7. You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8. You must NOT return an empty path, there is a solution to the maze.\n\nOutput:\n  - A single Python list of (row, col) tuples, in order from the start to the end, including both endpoints.\n  - The entire list must appear on one line, with no extra text or commentary.\n\nHere is the maze map (each line is one row):\n###############################\n....#...#.......#.#.#...#.....#\n#.###.###.###.###.#.#.#####.###\n#.......#.#.....#.#.#.#.#...#.#\n###.#########.###.#.#.#.###.#.#\n#.#...#.#.#.....#.....#.#.#...#\n#.#.###.#.###.###.#####.#.#.###\n#.....#...........#.#...#.#.#.#\n###.#########.#.###.#.#.#.#.#.#\n#.....#.#.#.#.#.#...#.#...#...#\n###.#.#.#.#.#.#####.###.###.###\n#...#.....#.#...#.....#.......#\n#######.###.#.#.###.###.###.###\n#.....#.#.....#.#.....#...#.#.#\n###.###.###.#.###.#.###.#####.#\n#.#...#.#.#.#...#.#.#.....#.#.#\n#.###.#.#.###.#####.###.#.#.#.#\n#.#.........#...#.....#.#...#.#\n#.#######.###.#.#.#.#.###.###.#\n#.#...#...#...#.#.#.#...#.#.#.#\n#.###.###.###.#########.#.#.#.#\n#.....#.#.#...#...#.#.#...#...#\n#.#.#.#.#.###.#.###.#.#.###.###\n#.#.#...........#.............#\n#.###.###.###.#.#######.#.###.#\n#...#.#...#...#.........#...#.#\n#####.#.#.#####.#.#.###.#######\n#.....#.#.#.....#.#.#.#.......#\n#.#####.#######.#####.#.#####.#\n#.#.....#.........#.......#....\n###############################",
