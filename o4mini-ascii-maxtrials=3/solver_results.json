You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5. You cannot revisit any cell (including the start and end points if part of a longer path attempt).\n  6. You must return a valid path from the start to the end.\n  7. You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8. You must NOT return an empty path, there is a solution to the maze.\n\nOutput:\n  - A single Python list of (row, col) tuples, in order from the start to the end, including both endpoints.\n  - The entire list must appear on one line, with no extra text or commentary.\n\nHere is the maze map (each line is one row):\n#########################\n..#...#...........#.....#\n#.#.###.#############.###\n#.....#.....#...........#\n###.###.###.#.###.#.#.#.#\n#.#.#.#...#.#...#.#.#.#.#\n#.#.#.###.###.###########\n#.#...#.........#...#.#.#\n#.#.#.###.###.#.#.###.#.#\n#...#.#.#...#.#.........#\n#.#.###.#.###.#.#####.#.#\n#.#...#.....#.#.#.#...#.#\n#.#####.#.#####.#.###.#.#\n#.#.....#.....#...#...#.#\n#.###.###########.###.###\n#...#.....#.....#...#.#.#\n#.###.#######.#########.#\n#...#...........#...#.#.#\n#.###.#######.###.###.#.#\n#...#...#...#.........#.#\n#.#####.###.###.#######.#\n#.#.#...#.....#.........#\n#.#.#.###.#####.#.###.#.#\n#.............#.#...#.#..\n#########################",

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You must NOT return an empty path, there is a solution to the maze.\n\nOutput:\n  - A single Python list of (row, col) tuples, in order from the start to the end, including both endpoints.\n  - The entire list must appear on one line, with no extra text or commentary.\n\nHere is the maze map (each line is one row):\n###############################\n....#.#...#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.....#\n#.###.###.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.###.#\n#...#.#.......#.#.#.........#.#\n#.###.###.#.###.#.#.###.#.#####\n#.....#.#.#.#.......#...#.#.#.#\n#.#####.#.###.#####.#######.#.#\n#.#.#.#...#.......#.....#...#.#\n#.#.#.###.#.#.#############.#.#\n#...#.#.#...#...#.#.#.....#...#\n###.#.#.#.#######.#.#####.#.###\n#.#.....#.......#.#.#.........#\n#.#.#.#.#.###.###.#.#####.#.#.#\n#...#.#...#.....#...#.....#.#.#\n###.#####.###.#.###.###.#####.#\n#.#.#.#...#.#.#.#.#.#...#.#...#\n#.###.###.#.#.###.#.###.#.#.#.#\n#.....#.....#.#.....#...#.#.#.#\n#####.###.#######.###.###.#####\n#.#.#...#...#.#.#.#.........#.#\n#.#.#.###.###.#.#.#.###.#####.#\n#.....#...#.........#.....#...#\n#####.###.###.###.#.###.###.#.#\n#...............#.#.#.#.#...#.#\n###.#####.#.#.#.#.#.#.###.#####\n#.....#...#.#.#.#.#.........#.#\n###.#####.#########.###.#.###.#\n#...#...#...#.#...#.#.#.#.#...#\n#.#.#.#.#.###.#.#.#.#.#.#####.#\n#.#.#.#.........#.#...#........\n###############################\n\nHere is a previous attempt (Attempt #1) including all steps:\n[]\nThis path was invalid.

You must NOT return an empty path, there is a solution to the maze.\n\nOutput:\n  - A single Python list of (row, col) tuples, in order from the start to the end, including both endpoints.\n  - The entire list must appear on one line, with no extra text or commentary.\n\nHere is the maze map (each line is one row):\n###############################\n....#.#...#.......#.#.#.#.#...#\n#.#.#.###.#######.#.#.#.#.###.#\n#.#.#.......#.#.#.#...#.#.#...#\n#.#####.#####.#.#.###.#.#.#.###\n#.#.#...#.#.#.#.......#.......#\n#.#.###.#.#.#.###.#.#.#.#######\n#...#.#.#...#.#.#.#.#.#...#...#\n#.###.#.#.###.#.###.###.#####.#\n#.....#...#...#...#...#...#.#.#\n#####.#.###.###.#.#.###.###.#.#\n#...#...#.#...#.#.#...#.#.#...#\n#.###.#.#.#.#.#.###.###.#.#.###\n#.....#...#.#.#.....#.#.#.....#\n#.#####.#.###.#####.#.#.#.#.#.#\n#.#.#.#.#.#.....#...#.#...#.#.#\n#.#.#.#.#.#.#######.#.#.#######\n#.#...#.#.#.................#.#\n#####.###.#.###.#.#.###.###.#.#\n#.#.#.#.......#.#.#...#.#.....#\n#.#.#.###.#.#####.###.#.#####.#\n#.........#.....#.#.#.#.#.#...#\n#####.#####.#.###.#.###.#.###.#\n#.....#.#...#...#.#.........#.#\n###.#.#.###.#.#####.#.#.###.#.#\n#...#.#.....#.#.....#.#.#...#.#\n###.#.###.#.###.###.###.###.#.#\n#...#...#.#...#.#...#...#...#.#\n#.#.###.#######.###.###.#.#.###\n#.#.#.....#.....#.....#.#.#....\n###############################",

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5. You cannot revisit any cell (including the start and end points if part of a longer path attempt).\n  6. You must return a valid path from the start to the end.\n  7. You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8. You must NOT return an empty path, there is a solution to the maze.\n\nOutput:\n  - A single Python list of (row, col) tuples, in order from the start to the end, including both endpoints.\n  - The entire list must appear on one line, with no extra text or commentary.\n\nHere is the maze map (each line is one row):\n###############################\n....#.#...#.......#.#.#.#.#...#\n#.#.#.###.#######.#.#.#.#.###.#\n#.#.#.......#.#.#.#...#.#.#...#\n#.#####.#####.#.#.###.#.#.#.###\n#.#.#...#.#.#.#.......#.......#\n#.#.###.#.#.#.###.#.#.#.#######\n#...#.#.#...#.#.#.#.#.#...#...#\n#.###.#.#.###.#.###.###.#####.#\n#.....#...#...#...#...#...#.#.#\n#####.#.###.###.#.#.###.###.#.#\n#...#...#.#...#.#.#...#.#.#...#\n#.###.#.#.#.#.#.###.###.#.#.###\n#.....#...#.#.#.....#.#.#.....#\n#.#####.#.###.#####.#.#.#.#.#.#\n#.#.#.#.#.#.....#...#.#...#.#.#\n#.#.#.#.#.#.#######.#.#.#######\n#.#...#.#.#.................#.#\n#####.###.#.###.#.#.###.###.#.#\n#.#.#.#.......#.#.#...#.#.....#\n#.#.#.###.#.#####.###.#.#####.#\n#.........#.....#.#.#.#.#.#...#\n#####.#####.#.###.#.###.#.###.#\n#.....#.#...#...#.#.........#.#\n###.#.#.###.#.#####.#.#.###.#.#\n#...#.#.....#.#.....#.#.#...#.#\n###.#.###.#.###.###.###.###.#.#\n#...#...#.#...#.#...#...#...#.#\n#.#.###.#######.###.###.#.#.###\n#.#.#.....#.....#.....#.#.#....\n###############################\n\nHere is a previous attempt (Attempt #1) including all steps until the first invalid step ((5, 2)) at index 6:\n[(1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2)]\nThe last point shown was where the path became invalid.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5. You cannot revisit any cell (including the start and end points if part of a longer path attempt).\n  6. You must return a valid path from the start to the end.\n  7. You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5. You cannot revisit any cell (including the start and end points if part of a longer path attempt).\n  6. You must return a valid path from the start to the end.\n  7. You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5. You cannot revisit any cell (including the start and end points if part of a longer path attempt).\n  6. You must return a valid path from the start to the end.\n  7. You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8. You must NOT return an empty path, there is a solution to the maze.\n\nOutput:\n  - A single Python list of (row, col) tuples, in order from the start to the end, including both endpoints.\n  - The entire list must appear on one line, with no extra text or commentary.\n\nHere is the maze map (each line is one row):\n###############################\n....#...#.......#.#.#...#.....#\n#.###.###.###.###.#.#.#####.###\n#.......#.#.....#.#.#.#.#...#.#\n###.#########.###.#.#.#.###.#.#\n#.#...#.#.#.....#.....#.#.#...#\n#.#.###.#.###.###.#####.#.#.###\n#.....#...........#.#...#.#.#.#\n###.#########.#.###.#.#.#.#.#.#\n#.....#.#.#.#.#.#...#.#...#...#\n###.#.#.#.#.#.#####.###.###.###\n#...#.....#.#...#.....#.......#\n#######.###.#.#.###.###.###.###\n#.....#.#.....#.#.....#...#.#.#\n###.###.###.#.###.#.###.#####.#\n#.#...#.#.#.#...#.#.#.....#.#.#\n#.###.#.#.###.#####.###.#.#.#.#\n#.#.........#...#.....#.#...#.#\n#.#######.###.#.#.#.#.###.###.#\n#.#...#...#...#.#.#.#...#.#.#.#\n#.###.###.###.#########.#.#.#.#\n#.....#.#.#...#...#.#.#...#...#\n#.#.#.#.#.###.#.###.#.#.###.###\n#.#.#...........#.............#\n#.###.###.###.#.#######.#.###.#\n#...#.#...#...#.........#...#.#\n#####.#.#.#####.#.#.###.#######\n#.....#.#.#.....#.#.#.#.......#\n#.#####.#######.#####.#.#####.#\n#.#.....#.........#.......#....\n###############################\n\nHere is a previous attempt (Attempt #1) including all steps until the first invalid step ((8, 9)) at index 22:\n[(1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (10, 5), (11, 5), (11, 6), (11, 7), (11, 8), (11, 9), (10, 9), (9, 9), (8, 9)]\nThe last point shown was where the path became invalid.
