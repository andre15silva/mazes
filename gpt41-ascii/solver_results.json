You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5. You cannot revisit any cell (including the start and end points if part of a longer path attempt).\n  6. You must return a valid path from the start to the end.\n  7. You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8. You must NOT return an empty path, there is a solution to the maze.\n\nOutput:\n  - A single Python list of (row, col) tuples, in order from the start to the end, including both endpoints.\n  - The entire list must appear on one line, with no extra text or commentary.\n\nHere is the maze map (each line is one row):\n#####################\n..#...#...#.#.#...#.#\n#.#.#.#.###.#.###.#.#\n#.#.#.#.........#...#\n#.###.#.#########.###\n#...#.......#.....#.#\n###.#.#######.###.#.#\n#.............#.....#\n#.#.#.#.#.#.#######.#\n#.#.#.#.#.#...#.....#\n#####.#####.###.###.#\n#.........#...#.#...#\n#####.#######.#####.#\n#.#...#.#.#.....#...#\n#.#.###.#.###.#.#####\n#.........#.#.#.....#\n#.###.###.#.#.#.#####\n#...#.#...#...#.....#\n#.###########.#####.#\n#...........#.....#..\n#####################\n\nHere is a previous attempt (Attempt #1) including all steps until the first invalid step ((2, 0)) at index 1:\n[(1, 0), (2, 0)]\nThe last point shown was where the path became invalid.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5. You cannot revisit any cell (including the start and end points if part of a longer path attempt).\n  6. You must return a valid path from the start to the end.\n  7. You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8.

Do not repeat this mistake. You may need to backtrack from earlier valid steps. Do not assume all other steps before the error are correct parts of the final solution.\n\nHere is a previous attempt (Attempt #2) including all steps until the first invalid step ((2, 3)) at index 4:\n[(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]\nThe last point shown was where the path became invalid.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8. You must NOT return an empty path, there is a solution to the maze.\n\nOutput:\n  - A single Python list of (row, col) tuples, in order from the start to the end, including both endpoints.\n  - The entire list must appear on one line, with no extra text or commentary.\n\nHere is the maze map (each line is one row):\n###################\n..#.#...........#.#\n#.#.#####.###.###.#\n#.........#.#.....#\n#.#.#.###.#.###.###\n#.#.#...#.#.....#.#\n#.###.#####.###.#.#\n#.#.#...#.....#...#\n###.###########.#.#\n#.#.............#.#\n#.#.#.#.#.###.###.#\n#...#.#.#.#.....#.#\n#########.###.#####\n#.#.......#.#.....#\n#.#.#######.#####.#\n#...#.............#\n#############.#.###\n#.............#....\n###################\n\nHere is a previous attempt (Attempt #1) including all steps until the first invalid step ((2, 0)) at index 1:\n[(1, 0), (2, 0)]\nThe last point shown was where the path became invalid.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.
