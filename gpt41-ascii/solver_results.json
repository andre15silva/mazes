You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5. You cannot revisit any cell (including the start and end points if part of a longer path attempt).\n  6. You must return a valid path from the start to the end.\n  7. You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8. You must NOT return an empty path, there is a solution to the maze.\n\nOutput:\n  - A single Python list of (row, col) tuples, in order from the start to the end, including both endpoints.\n  - The entire list must appear on one line, with no extra text or commentary.\n\nHere is the maze map (each line is one row):\n#####################\n..#...#...#.#.#...#.#\n#.#.#.#.###.#.###.#.#\n#.#.#.#.........#...#\n#.###.#.#########.###\n#...#.......#.....#.#\n###.#.#######.###.#.#\n#.............#.....#\n#.#.#.#.#.#.#######.#\n#.#.#.#.#.#...#.....#\n#####.#####.###.###.#\n#.........#...#.#...#\n#####.#######.#####.#\n#.#...#.#.#.....#...#\n#.#.###.#.###.#.#####\n#.........#.#.#.....#\n#.###.###.#.#.#.#####\n#...#.#...#...#.....#\n#.###########.#####.#\n#...........#.....#..\n#####################\n\nHere is a previous attempt (Attempt #1) including all steps until the first invalid step ((2, 0)) at index 1:\n[(1, 0), (2, 0)]\nThe last point shown was where the path became invalid.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5. You cannot revisit any cell (including the start and end points if part of a longer path attempt).\n  6. You must return a valid path from the start to the end.\n  7. You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8. You must NOT return an empty path, there is a solution to the maze.\n\nOutput:\n  - A single Python list of (row, col) tuples, in order from the start to the end, including both endpoints.\n  - The entire list must appear on one line, with no extra text or commentary.\n\nHere is the maze map (each line is one row):\n#########################\n..#...#.....#...#...#.#.#\n#.#.#####.#.###.###.#.#.#\n#...#.#...#.#.#.#.#.....#\n#.#.#.###.###.#.#.#.#####\n#.#...#.#...#.......#.#.#\n#.#####.###.###.###.#.#.#\n#.#.#...#.#.......#.#.#.#\n#.#.###.#.#.###.#####.#.#\n#...#.#.#.#.#.#...#.#...#\n#.#.#.#.#.###.#.###.#.###\n#.#.....................#\n#.###.###.#.#####.#####.#\n#.#.....#.#.#.#.....#...#\n###.#.#####.#.#######.#.#\n#...#...#...........#.#.#\n#.#########.#######.#.###\n#.#.#.............#.#.#.#\n#.#.#.#.###.#####.###.#.#\n#.#...#.#...#.#.#.#.....#\n###.#######.#.#.#####.###\n#...#...............#...#\n###.###.###.#####.###.###\n#...#...#.......#.#......\n#########################\n\nHere is a previous attempt (Attempt #1) including all steps until the first invalid step ((2, 0)) at index 1:\n[(1, 0), (2, 0)]\nThe last point shown was where the path became invalid.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5. You cannot revisit any cell (including the start and end points if part of a longer path attempt).\n  6. You must return a valid path from the start to the end.\n  7. You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8. You must NOT return an empty path, there is a solution to the maze.\n\nOutput:\n  - A single Python list of (row, col) tuples, in order from the start to the end, including both endpoints.\n  - The entire list must appear on one line, with no extra text or commentary.\n\nHere is the maze map (each line is one row):\n#######################\n..#.....#.#.........#.#\n#.#####.#.#######.###.#\n#.....#.......#.......#\n#.###.###.###.###.#.#.#\n#.#.......#.#.....#.#.#\n###.#######.#####.#####\n#.....#.#.........#...#\n#######.#.#####.#.#.###\n#...........#...#.....#\n#####.#.#.#.###.#####.#\n#.#...#.#.#.#...#.....#\n#.#.#########.#.###.#.#\n#...#...#.....#.#...#.#\n#.###.###.#.#.#####.###\n#.#.......#.#.....#...#\n#.#####.#.###.#.#.###.#\n#...#...#.#...#.#.#...#\n#.#####.###.#.#######.#\n#.#.......#.#.#.#.....#\n#.#####.#####.#.#####.#\n#.#.........#.#........\n#######################\n\nHere is a previous attempt (Attempt #1) including all steps until the first invalid step ((2, 0)) at index 1:\n[(1, 0), (2, 0)]\nThe last point shown was where the path became invalid.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You must NOT return an empty path, there is a solution to the maze.\n\nOutput:\n  - A single Python list of (row, col) tuples, in order from the start to the end, including both endpoints.\n  - The entire list must appear on one line, with no extra text or commentary.\n\nHere is the maze map (each line is one row):\n#########################\n..#.#.#.#.#.......#...#.#\n#.#.#.#.#.#####.###.###.#\n#.............#.#.#.....#\n#####.#####.###.#.###.###\n#.#.#.#...........#...#.#\n#.#.#.###.#.#.#######.#.#\n#.....#...#.#...#.......#\n###.#########.#######.###\n#.....#.#...#.........#.#\n#######.###.#######.###.#\n#...#.....#.#.......#...#\n###.###.#.#.#######.#.###\n#.#...#.#.#.#.#...#.....#\n#.###.###.#.#.###.#.#####\n#...............#.#.....#\n#.#####.#.#.#####.###.###\n#.#.#...#.#.............#\n###.###.#####.###.#.#.###\n#.........#...#...#.#...#\n###.#.#######.#######.###\n#.#.#.#.......#.#.......#\n#.#.#########.#.###.#.###\n#.......#.......#...#....\n#########################\n\nHere is a previous attempt (Attempt #1) including all steps until the first invalid step ((2, 0)) at index 1:\n[(1, 0), (2, 0)]\nThe last point shown was where the path became invalid.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5. You cannot revisit any cell (including the start and end points if part of a longer path attempt).\n  6. You must return a valid path from the start to the end.\n  7. You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8. You must NOT return an empty path, there is a solution to the maze.\n\nOutput:\n  - A single Python list of (row, col) tuples, in order from the start to the end, including both endpoints.\n  - The entire list must appear on one line, with no extra text or commentary.\n\nHere is the maze map (each line is one row):\n#######################\n................#.....#\n#######.#####.#####.###\n#.#.......#.........#.#\n#.###.#############.#.#\n#.....#.........#.....#\n#.###.#########.#####.#\n#.#...#...#.#.......#.#\n#.#######.#.#######.#.#\n#.#.........#...#.#...#\n#.#######.#.###.#.###.#\n#.#...#...#.#.........#\n#####.#####.###.#.###.#\n#.#.............#.#...#\n#.###############.###.#\n#...#...#.#.....#.#...#\n#.#.###.#.#.#.###.###.#\n#.#.#.#...#.#.......#.#\n#.###.###.###.###.#.#.#\n#.............#.#.#.#.#\n#####.#####.###.#.#.#.#\n#.......#.....#...#.#..\n#######################\n\nHere is a previous attempt (Attempt #1) including all steps until the first invalid step ((2, 0)) at index 1:\n[(1, 0), (2, 0)]\nThe last point shown was where the path became invalid.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8. You must NOT return an empty path, there is a solution to the maze.\n\nOutput:\n  - A single Python list of (row, col) tuples, in order from the start to the end, including both endpoints.\n  - The entire list must appear on one line, with no extra text or commentary.\n\nHere is the maze map (each line is one row):\n###########################\n................#...#.#.#.#\n#####.#########.###.#.#.#.#\n#.#...#.#.................#\n#.#.#.#.#.###.###.#.###.#.#\n#.#.#.#.#.#.....#.#.#.#.#.#\n#.#####.###.#######.#.#.###\n#...........#.......#.#...#\n#####.###.#.###.#####.#.###\n#.#...#.#.#.#...#.........#\n#.#.###.#.#.###.#.#.###.#.#\n#.....#.#.#.#...#.#.#...#.#\n#.#####.#.#####.###.#.###.#\n#.#.#.......#...#...#.#.#.#\n#.#.###.#.#########.#.#.###\n#.#.....#.#...#.#.#.#.....#\n###.#.#######.#.#.###.###.#\n#...#...#.#.#...........#.#\n#########.#.#.#.#.#.###.###\n#...#.........#.#.#.#.....#\n#.#########.#######.###.###\n#.........#...#.......#...#\n#.#.#####.#.#####.###.#.#.#\n#.#.#.........#...#.#.#.#.#\n#.#.#.###.#.#.###.#.###.#.#\n#.#.#.#...#.#.#.......#.#..\n###########################\n\nHere is a previous attempt (Attempt #1) including all steps until the first invalid step ((2, 0)) at index 1:\n[(1, 0), (2, 0)]\nThe last point shown was where the path became invalid.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5. You cannot revisit any cell (including the start and end points if part of a longer path attempt).\n  6. You must return a valid path from the start to the end.\n  7. You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8. You must NOT return an empty path, there is a solution to the maze.\n\nOutput:\n  - A single Python list of (row, col) tuples, in order from the start to the end, including both endpoints.\n  - The entire list must appear on one line, with no extra text or commentary.\n\nHere is the maze map (each line is one row):\n#############################\n..#.....#.#...#...#.#.#.#.#.#\n#.###.###.#.###.###.#.#.#.#.#\n#.#.#.....#.#.....#.#.......#\n#.#.#####.#.###.###.#.#######\n#.....#.#.....#...#.........#\n###.###.#.#.#.#.###.#.#######\n#...#.#.#.#.#.....#.#...#...#\n###.#.#.#####.#######.#####.#\n#.#.#...#.......#.#.....#...#\n#.#.###.#####.#.#.###.#.###.#\n#.....#.#.#.#.#.#.#...#...#.#\n#####.#.#.#.###.#.###.#####.#\n#.......#.......#.....#.....#\n#######.#####.#######.#.#####\n#.#.#.......#.#.....#.#.#...#\n#.#.#######.#.#####.#.#.#.###\n#.....#.#.......#.#.........#\n#.#####.#####.###.#.###.#####\n#.....#.#...#.#.#.....#.#...#\n###.###.###.#.#.#.#######.###\n#.......#.#.............#...#\n#.#.###.#.#.#########.#.###.#\n#.#.#...............#.#.#...#\n#####.#.###.###.#########.###\n#.....#.#...#.#...#.........#\n#.###.#######.#.#######.#.#.#\n#.#.....#...............#.#..\n#############################\n\nHere is a previous attempt (Attempt #1) including all steps until the first invalid step ((2, 0)) at index 1:\n[(1, 0), (2, 0)]\nThe last point shown was where the path became invalid.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5. You cannot revisit any cell (including the start and end points if part of a longer path attempt).\n  6. You must return a valid path from the start to the end.\n  7. You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8. You must NOT return an empty path, there is a solution to the maze.\n\nOutput:\n  - A single Python list of (row, col) tuples, in order from the start to the end, including both endpoints.\n  - The entire list must appear on one line, with no extra text or commentary.\n\nHere is the maze map (each line is one row):\n#############################\n..#.#.#.#.#...#...#.........#\n#.#.#.#.#.###.###.#####.###.#\n#.#.#.#.#.................#.#\n#.#.#.#.###########.###.#####\n#...#.#...............#.#.#.#\n#.###.#######.###.#.#####.#.#\n#...#.#.#.....#...#.........#\n#.###.#.#.###.###.###.###.###\n#.#.......#...#...#...#.....#\n#.###.#.#.#.#.#######.#.#.###\n#.....#.#.#.#...#.....#.#...#\n###.#####.#.#.#####.#.###.#.#\n#...#.....#.#.#.....#.#...#.#\n#.#.#######.#######.###.#.#.#\n#.#.......#.#.........#.#.#.#\n#.#.#######.#.#.#.#.#.###.###\n#.#.#.......#.#.#.#.#...#.#.#\n#.#####.###.###.#.#.#.#####.#\n#.#...#.#...#...#.#.#.......#\n#####.#.###.###.#.###.#.#####\n#.#.#.....#...#.#.#...#.....#\n#.#.#.###.#.#.###.#.###.#####\n#.....#...#.#.#...#.#.......#\n#.#.#.#####.#####.###.###.###\n#.#.#...#.....#...#...#.#...#\n#.#########.#####.#####.#.###\n#.......#.....#.....#........\n#############################\n\nHere is a previous attempt (Attempt #1) including all steps until the first invalid step ((2, 0)) at index 1:\n[(1, 0), (2, 0)]\nThe last point shown was where the path became invalid.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8. You must NOT return an empty path, there is a solution to the maze.\n\nOutput:\n  - A single Python list of (row, col) tuples, in order from the start to the end, including both endpoints.\n  - The entire list must appear on one line, with no extra text or commentary.\n\nHere is the maze map (each line is one row):\n###########################\n..#.........#.....#...#.#.#\n#.#.#######.#.#######.#.#.#\n#.#.#.#.....#...#.........#\n#.###.#####.#.#####.#####.#\n#.#.............#.....#.#.#\n#.###########.#.#.#####.#.#\n#...#.#...#...#.#.......#.#\n#.###.###.###.#####.#######\n#.#.....#...#.....#.......#\n#.###.###.###.#####.###.###\n#.....#.......#.#...#.#.#.#\n#.###.#.#.#.###.#.###.###.#\n#.#.#.#.#.#...............#\n###.#.#########.###.###.###\n#...............#...#.#...#\n#####.#.#.#.###.###.#.#.###\n#.....#.#.#.#...#.....#...#\n#.#.###.#####.#.#####.#####\n#.#.#...#.....#.....#.....#\n#.###.#.###.###.#.#.#.#####\n#...#.#.#...#...#.#.#.#.#.#\n#######.###.#.###.#.#.#.#.#\n#.......#...#...#.#.#.....#\n#.###.#.#####.#.###.#.###.#\n#.#...#.....#.#.#...#.#....\n###########################\n\nHere is a previous attempt (Attempt #1) including all steps until the first invalid step ((2, 0)) at index 1:\n[(1, 0), (2, 0)]\nThe last point shown was where the path became invalid.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You must NOT return an empty path, there is a solution to the maze.\n\nOutput:\n  - A single Python list of (row, col) tuples, in order from the start to the end, including both endpoints.\n  - The entire list must appear on one line, with no extra text or commentary.\n\nHere is the maze map (each line is one row):\n###############################\n....#.....#.....#.......#.#.#.#\n###.#.#######.###.#####.#.#.#.#\n#.#.....#...#...#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#\n#.#.#####.#####.#.#.#.###.#.#.#\n#...#.......#...........#.#.#.#\n###.#.###.###.#.###.#####.#.#.#\n#...#...#...#.#...#.#.........#\n###.#.#########.#######.#######\n#.....#...#.#.#.#.#.....#...#.#\n###.###.###.#.#.#.###.###.###.#\n#...#.#.#...#.......#.#...#...#\n###.#.#.###.#.#.#####.#.#####.#\n#.......#...#.#.#.........#.#.#\n###.#######.###.#.###.#####.#.#\n#...................#.#...#...#\n###.###.#.###.###.###.#.###.###\n#.....#.#.#.....#...#...#.....#\n#.#.#####.###.#.#.#.#####.###.#\n#.#.....#.#.#.#.#.#...#.#...#.#\n###.#######.#####.###.#.#.#.#.#\n#...#.#.........#.#.#.....#.#.#\n###.#.#.###.#####.#.#.#.#.#####\n#.........#.#.#.....#.#.#...#.#\n#.#.#.###.###.#.#.###.#.#.#.#.#\n#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#...#.#.#...#\n#.###.#.###.#.#.#####.#####.#.#\n#.#.#.........#...#...#.....#.#\n#.#.#.#.###.#.#######.###.#.###\n#.#...#...#.#.....#...#...#....\n###############################",

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5. You cannot revisit any cell (including the start and end points if part of a longer path attempt).\n  6. You must return a valid path from the start to the end.\n  7. You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8. You must NOT return an empty path, there is a solution to the maze.\n\nOutput:\n  - A single Python list of (row, col) tuples, in order from the start to the end, including both endpoints.\n  - The entire list must appear on one line, with no extra text or commentary.\n\nHere is the maze map (each line is one row):\n###############################\n....#...#.......#.#.#...#.....#\n#.###.###.###.###.#.#.#####.###\n#.......#.#.....#.#.#.#.#...#.#\n###.#########.###.#.#.#.###.#.#\n#.#...#.#.#.....#.....#.#.#...#\n#.#.###.#.###.###.#####.#.#.###\n#.....#...........#.#...#.#.#.#\n###.#########.#.###.#.#.#.#.#.#\n#.....#.#.#.#.#.#...#.#...#...#\n###.#.#.#.#.#.#####.###.###.###\n#...#.....#.#...#.....#.......#\n#######.###.#.#.###.###.###.###\n#.....#.#.....#.#.....#...#.#.#\n###.###.###.#.###.#.###.#####.#\n#.#...#.#.#.#...#.#.#.....#.#.#\n#.###.#.#.###.#####.###.#.#.#.#\n#.#.........#...#.....#.#...#.#\n#.#######.###.#.#.#.#.###.###.#\n#.#...#...#...#.#.#.#...#.#.#.#\n#.###.###.###.#########.#.#.#.#\n#.....#.#.#...#...#.#.#...#...#\n#.#.#.#.#.###.#.###.#.#.###.###\n#.#.#...........#.............#\n#.###.###.###.#.#######.#.###.#\n#...#.#...#...#.........#...#.#\n#####.#.#.#####.#.#.###.#######\n#.....#.#.#.....#.#.#.#.......#\n#.#####.#######.#####.#.#####.#\n#.#.....#.........#.......#....\n###############################\n\nHere is a previous attempt (Attempt #1) including all steps until the first invalid step ((2, 0)) at index 1:\n[(1, 0), (2, 0)]\nThe last point shown was where the path became invalid.

You may move one cell at a time: up, down, left, or right.\n  2. No diagonal moves.\n  3. No jumping over # cells.\n  4. You cannot move into # cells.\n  5.

You must return a complete path, not a partial path.\n  8.

You must NOT return an empty path, there is a solution to the maze.\n\nOutput:\n  - A single Python list of (row, col) tuples, in order from the start to the end, including both endpoints.\n  - The entire list must appear on one line, with no extra text or commentary.\n\nHere is the maze map (each line is one row):\n###############################\n....#.#...#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.....#\n#.###.###.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.###.#\n#...#.#.......#.#.#.........#.#\n#.###.###.#.###.#.#.###.#.#####\n#.....#.#.#.#.......#...#.#.#.#\n#.#####.#.###.#####.#######.#.#\n#.#.#.#...#.......#.....#...#.#\n#.#.#.###.#.#.#############.#.#\n#...#.#.#...#...#.#.#.....#...#\n###.#.#.#.#######.#.#####.#.###\n#.#.....#.......#.#.#.........#\n#.#.#.#.#.###.###.#.#####.#.#.#\n#...#.#...#.....#...#.....#.#.#\n###.#####.###.#.###.###.#####.#\n#.#.#.#...#.#.#.#.#.#...#.#...#\n#.###.###.#.#.###.#.###.#.#.#.#\n#.....#.....#.#.....#...#.#.#.#\n#####.###.#######.###.###.#####\n#.#.#...#...#.#.#.#.........#.#\n#.#.#.###.###.#.#.#.###.#####.#\n#.....#...#.........#.....#...#\n#####.###.###.###.#.###.###.#.#\n#...............#.#.#.#.#...#.#\n###.#####.#.#.#.#.#.#.###.#####\n#.....#...#.#.#.#.#.........#.#\n###.#####.#########.###.#.###.#\n#...#...#...#.#...#.#.#.#.#...#\n#.#.#.#.#.###.#.#.#.#.#.#####.#\n#.#.#.#.........#.#...#........\n###############################\n\nHere is a previous attempt (Attempt #1) including all steps until the first invalid step ((2, 0)) at index 1:\n[(1, 0), (2, 0)]\nThe last point shown was where the path became invalid.
